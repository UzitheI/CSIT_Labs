## TRUTH TABLE OF NAND GATE

| A   | B   | A(NAND)B |
| --- | --- | -------- |
| 0   | 0   | 1        |
| 0   | 1   | 1        |
| 1   | 0   | 1        |
| 1   | 1   | 0        |

## TRUTH TABLE OF NOR GATE

| A   | B   | A(NOR)B |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| 0   | 0   | 1       |
| 0   | 1   | 0       |
| 1   | 0   | 0       |
| 1   | 1   | 0       |

## RESULT

The truth table of UNIVERSAL gates is verified successfully.
