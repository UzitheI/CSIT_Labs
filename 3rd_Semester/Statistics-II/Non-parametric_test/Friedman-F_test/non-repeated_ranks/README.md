# Friedman F test

## Non-repeated ranks

## Steps

_for example of data set:_

A survey was conducted in four hospitals in a particular city to obtain the number of babies born over a 12 months' period. This time period was divided into four seasons to test the hypothesis that the birth rate is constant over all the four seasons. The results of the survey were as follows:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="2">Hospital</th>
            <th colspan="4">No. of births</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Winter</td>
            <td>Spring</td>
            <td>Summer</td>
            <td>Fall</td>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>92</td>
            <td>72</td>
            <td>94</td>
            <td>77</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>B</td>
            <td>15</td>
            <td>16</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>17</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>C</td>
            <td>58</td>
            <td>71</td>
            <td>51</td>
            <td>62</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>D</td>
            <td>19</td>
            <td>26</td>
            <td>20</td>
            <td>18</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
