# Practicals

- [WAP to find prefixes, suffixes, and substring from given string.](./prefix.cpp)
- [Construct the DFA for the language of string over {0, 1} in which each string end with 11. Also WAP to simulate equivalent DFA.](./ending_11_string.cpp)
- [WAP to validate C identifiers and keywords.](./identifies.cpp)
- [Construct the DFA for the language of string over {a,b} such that each string contain aba as substring. Also WAP to simulate equivalent DFA.](./substring_aba.cpp)
