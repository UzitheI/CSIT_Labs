The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence. `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...`

In mathematical terms, the sequence `F(n)` of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation

```c
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```

with seed values `F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.`

#### Algorithm

Fib(n)
    if n == 0
        return 0
    else if n == 1

    for i = 0 to n-1
        if A[i] == x

    high = n-1
    while low <= high
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if A[mid] == x
            return mid
        else if A[mid] < x
            low = mid + 1

### [Bubble sort](./bubble_sort.cpp)

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort.
It can be practical if the input is usually in sort order but may occasionally have some out-of-order elements nearly in position.
The complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average case because the entire array needs to be iterated for every element.
However, the complexity is O(n) in the best case because the array needs to be iterated only once when the array is already sorted.
Bubble sort is adaptive. It means that for almost sorted array, it gives a good performance.
Bubble sort is stable. It means that the same element in the array will not be swapped.
Bubble sort is a comparison sort. It means that it sorts the array by comparing the elements of the array.
Bubble sort is an in-place sorting algorithm. It means that it does not require any extra space.
Bubble sort is not a recursive algorithm.

#### Algorithm

```cpp
BubbleSort(A, n)
    for i = 0 to n-1
        for j = 0 to n-i-1
            if A[j] > A[j+1]
                swap(A[j], A[j+1])
```

- Best case: `O(n)`
- Worst case: `O(n^2)`

- Auxiliary space complexity: `O(1)`
- Sorting in place: `Yes`
- Stable: `Yes`

### [Selection sort](./selection_sort.cpp)

Selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n^2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.

#### Algorithm

```cpp
SelectionSort(A, n)
    for i = 0 to n-1
        min = i
        for j = i+1 to n-1
            if A[j] < A[min]
                min = j
        swap(A[i], A[min])
```

- Stable: `No`

    for i = 1 to n-1
        key = A[i]
        j = i-1
        while j >= 0 and A[j] > key
            A[j+1] = A[j]
            j = j-1

    if n == 0
        return -1
    else
        mid = n/2
        if A[mid] == x
            return mid
        else if A[mid] < x
            return BinarySearch(A[mid+1, n], x)

Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.

#### Algorithm

```python
MergeSort(A, n)
    if n < 2
        return
    mid = n/2
    left = mid
    right = n - mid
    L[left], R[right]
    for i = 0 to left-1
        L[i] = A[i]
    for i = mid to n-1
        R[i-mid] = A[i]
    MergeSort(L, left)
    MergeSort(R, right)
    Merge(A, L, left, R, right)

Merge(A, L, left, R, right)
    i = 0
    j = 0
    k = 0
    while i < left and j < right
        if L[i] <= R[j]
            A[k] = L[i]
            i = i+1
        else
            A[k] = R[j]
            j = j+1
        k = k+1
    while i < left
        A[k] = L[i]
        i = i+1
        k = k+1
    while j < right
        A[k] = R[j]

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

#### Algorithm

```python
HeapSort(A, n)
    for i = n/2-1 to 0
        Heapify(A, n, i)
    for i = n-1 to 0
        swap(A[0], A[i])
        Heapify(A, i, 0)

Heapify(A, n, i)
    largest = i
    l = 2*i + 1
    r = 2*i + 2
    if l < n and A[l] > A[largest]
        largest = l
    if r < n and A[r] > A[largest]
        largest = r
    if largest != i
        swap(A[i], A[largest])
        Heapify(A, n, largest)

    for each vertex v in Graph
        key[v] = INT_MAX
