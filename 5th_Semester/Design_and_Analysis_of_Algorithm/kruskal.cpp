/*
* Program: Kruskal's Algorithm
* 
* Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest. 
* It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph adding increasing cost arcs at each step. 
* This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. 
* If the graph is not connected, then it finds a minimum spanning forest (a minimum spanning tree for each connected component).
*
* Time Complexity: O(ElogE) or O(ElogV). Sorting of edges takes O(ELogE) time. 
* After sorting, we iterate through all edges and apply find-union algorithm. 
* The find and union operations can take atmost O(LogV) time. So overall complexity is O(ELogE + ELogV) time. 
* The value of E can be atmost O(V2), so O(LogV) are O(LogE) same. 
* Therefore, overall time complexity is O(ElogE) or O(ElogV)
* Space Complexity: O(E + V)
