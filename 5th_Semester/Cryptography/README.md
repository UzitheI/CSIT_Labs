# Cryptography

## Programs

**Note:**

1. All the programs have Encryption followed by Decryption.
2. Key is taken from the user.

### Lab 1: Implement Shift Cipher

### Lab 2: Implement Playfair Cipher (display the key matrix as well)

### Lab 3: Implement Rail Fence Cipher

### Lab 4: Implement Vigenere Cipher

### Lab 5: Implement Euclidean Algorithm to find GCD of given numbers

### Lab 6: Computes additive inverse in given modulo n

### Lab 7: Takes two numbers and display whether they are relatively prime or not

### Lab 8: Implement Extended Euclidean Algorithm (Display the results of iterations in tabular format)

### Lab 9: WAP to compute multiplicative inverse in given modulo n using Extended Euclidean Algorithm

### Lab 10: Implement Hill Cipher (Key matrix of size 2\*2/ Encryption/ Decryption/)

(Lab Part-2)

### Lab 11: WAP to demonstrate how output of S-Box (S1) is generated in DES

### Lab 12: Implement Robin Miller algorithm for primality test

### Lab 13: that takes any positive number and display the result after computing Totient value

### Lab 14: Iompute primitive roots of given number

### Lab 15: WAP to compute discrete log of given number (provided the modulo and primitive root)

### Lab 16: WAP to implement Diffie-Helman Key Exchange Algorithm

### Lab 17: WAP to implement RSA Algorithm (Encryption/Decryption/ Input Should be taken from user)
